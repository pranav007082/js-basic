main things in dom manipulation are :

document.getElementById('pass id name')
document.etElementByClassName('pass class name')
document.querySelect('you can pass anything like id or classname')
all above returns html collectors

but this: document.querSelectAll('you can pass anything like id or classname') returns NodeList like array so if you want to access use indexes.
you can also use forEach() to change innercontent of nodelist elements for Nodelist but not for html collectors

in order to access multiple elements in html collectors we can convert it into array and use forEach()
eg:const myarr = Array.from(html collector name)
now you can forEach() in myarr
